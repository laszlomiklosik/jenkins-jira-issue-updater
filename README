This is a Jenkins plugin which updates issues in Jira (by changing their status, adding a comment or updating field values) as part of a Jenkins job.

Possible scenarios in which you might want to use it:

- in case you would like to announce or just log in Jira that the deployment of certain fixes / issues the acceptance server has completed (this makes sense if you already use Jenkins to deploy your applications to the acceptance web/app server).
- in case you would like to progress multiple Jira issues in the workflow (bulk changing the status of multiple Jira issues) and/or add a comment to issues after a Jenkins job has successfully completed.
- in case you would like to update fields in the Jira
- (Currently not supported) in case you would like Jenkins to update multiple issues when a new version of one of your projects is released (this makes sense if you use the "maven release plugin" and you trigger it from Jenkins).

Inputs:

- the Jira REST URL (e.g. http://something.com/rest/api/2)
- the Jira username and password to be used to connect to Jira
- a JQL query selecting the issues to be updated (e.g. project="JENKINS" and status="Pending deploy")
- the name of the workflow action to be executed (not mandatory)
- the message to be added (can use environment variable substitution) to each issue (not mandatory)
- The field name and value to be used (not mandatory)
