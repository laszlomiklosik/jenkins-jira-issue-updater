This is a Jenkins plugin which updates issues in Jira (by changing their status and adding a comment) as part of a Jenkins job.

Possible scenarios in which it can be used:
- in case you would like to announce or just log in Jira that the deployment of certain fixes / issues the acceptance server has completed 
  (of course this makes sense if you also use Jenkins to deploy your applications to the acceptance web/app server)
- in case you would like Jenkins to update multiple issues after the release (in sense of "maven release plugin") of a new version has completed
- in case you would like to progress multiple Jira issues in their workflow (bulk changing the status of multiple Jira issues) after a Jenkins job has successfully completed

Inputs:
- the Jira SOAP URL (e.g. https://something.com/rpc/soap/jirasoapservice-v2)
- the Jira username and password to be used to connect to Jira (e.g. project="JENKINS" and status="Resolved")
- a JQL query selecting the issues to be updated
- the name of the workflow to be executed (not mandatory)
- the message to be added to each issue (not mandatory)
